# Implementation Plan: Precision Meets Efficiency - Quantization in Radiology AI

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-15

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the plan for developing the manuscript "Precision Meets Efficiency: A Gentle Introduction to Quantization in Radiology AI" and its accompanying reproducible codebase. The goal is to provide a practical resource on quantization for the radiology AI community.

## 2. Phases

### Phase 1: Setup & Foundation (Estimated: 1-2 weeks)

*   **Goal:** Establish the project environment, acquire datasets, implement core utilities, and draft initial manuscript sections.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Finalize project structure and GitHub setup (âœ… Done).
    *   Set up Conda environment (`environment.yml`).
    *   Acquire and prepare datasets (ChestX-ray14, BraTS or similar). Update config paths.
    *   Implement common code utilities (`quantization_wrappers.py`, `evaluation_metrics.py`).
    *   Draft Manuscript Sections: Abstract, Introduction, Fundamentals, Techniques.
    *   Populate `bibliography.bib` with initial key references.

### Phase 2: Core Benchmarking & Application Section (Estimated: 2-4 weeks)

*   **Goal:** Implement, run, and validate the core CXR and MRI benchmarks. Draft the Applications section of the manuscript.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Implement CXR Benchmark: Data loader, model integration, full `run_cxr_benchmark.py` script logic.
    *   Run CXR Benchmark: Execute script for FP32, PTQ INT8, BNB INT8 methods. Collect results.
    *   Implement MRI Benchmark: Data loader (handling 3D data), model integration, full `run_mri_benchmark.py` script logic.
    *   Run MRI Benchmark: Execute script for FP32, PTQ INT8 methods. Collect results.
    *   Analyze benchmark results (Accuracy, Speed, Memory).
    *   Draft Manuscript Section: Applications in Radiology AI (incorporating benchmark findings).

### Phase 3: Refinement & Supporting Documents (Estimated: 1-2 weeks)

*   **Goal:** Refine code, finalize results analysis, draft remaining manuscript sections, and complete supporting documents.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Refine benchmark code for clarity and reproducibility. Add comments.
    *   Generate plots/tables for results (`results/figures_generated/`, `docs/figures/`, `docs/tables/`).
    *   Draft Manuscript Sections: Ethical/Practical Considerations, Future Directions, Conclusion.
    *   Complete References (`bibliography.bib`).
    *   Complete `docs/CLAIM_Checklist.md`.
    *   Complete `docs/Quantization_Readiness_Scorecard.md`.
    *   Review and refine entire manuscript draft.

### Phase 4: Review & Finalization (Estimated: 1 week)

*   **Goal:** Conduct internal review, incorporate feedback, perform final checks, and prepare for potential submission.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Internal review of manuscript and code.
    *   Incorporate feedback and make necessary revisions.
    *   Final proofread of manuscript.
    *   Ensure code runs cleanly based on `README.md` instructions.
    *   Validate Conda environment file.
    *   (Optional) Format manuscript according to target journal guidelines.

## 3. Resources

*   **Code:** `radiology_quantization_paper/code/`
*   **Manuscript:** `radiology_quantization_paper/manuscript/`
*   **Documents:** `radiology_quantization_paper/docs/`
*   **Progress Tracker:** `planning/PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`

## 4. Assumptions & Risks

*   **Assumption:** Access to suitable compute resources (CPU/GPU) for running benchmarks.
*   **Assumption:** Availability of public datasets (NIH CXR, BraTS).
*   **Risk:** Benchmark results may not align perfectly with abstract claims, requiring adjustments.
*   **Risk:** Implementing specific quantization techniques (e.g., QAT, advanced BNB usage) might be more complex than initially estimated.
*   **Risk:** Dataset loading and preprocessing for 3D MRI data can be time-consuming.

# results/README.md

This directory stores the outputs from running the benchmarks.

-   `processed/`: Contains processed results, typically CSV files summarizing metrics (AUC, Dice, Latency, Memory) across different quantization methods. These are generated by the benchmark scripts (e.g., `run_cxr_benchmark.py`).
-   `raw_outputs/`: (Optional, Gitignored) May contain more detailed logs, per-sample predictions, or intermediate files if needed for debugging or deeper analysis.
-   `figures_generated/`: (Optional, Gitignored) May store plots generated from the processed results (e.g., performance vs. resource curves).

The `.gitignore` file is configured to ignore the contents of `raw_outputs/` and `figures_generated/` by default to avoid committing large files. Processed summary files in `processed/` (like CSVs) are typically small enough to be versioned.
